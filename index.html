    <p>
        There are things that We are already learning about code. 
        It seems to promise easy wins in the beginning during the 
        introduction but soon becomes nightmarish when the code begins
        to scream at you!
    </p>

    <h3>Important Notes on the Journey</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Be free to ask any questions - Even though they may sound silly</li>
        <li>Try to make time to practice everyday - Its damn easy to forget these things</li>
        <li>Focus on track is important as you find there is so much to learn</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps to Front end Development</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Learn HTML and importantly git in the beginning</li>
        <li>Then there is the css to dress the skeletion structures</li>
        <li>Finally, Learn JavaScript and related frameworks</li>
